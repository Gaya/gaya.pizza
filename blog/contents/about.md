Gaya Ninja Blog is a weblog about web development written and managed by [Gaya Kessler](http://gaya.ninja), a guy
from a small town in the Netherlands.

Ever since I got the chance to get my hands dirty with web development I’ve been in love with it. Two years after
I started to learn how to make websites I took a job as a web developer. Not much longer after that I started writing
articles which ended up on my weblog.

A weblog for web developers, by a web developer
-----------------------------------------------
This blog is mainly for web developers who want to make the Internet a better place. I explain about solutions to
problems which we as web developers might bump into. I try my best to share my knowledge with the world. This blog
was brought to life so I could a place for my findings and write about it for my future self. After a while it got a
bit of traffic and it started to get more popular, since then I’ve been writing articles for the web development crowd
to read.

Which subjects you can expect to find here?
-------------------------------------------
You’ll find that I talk about anything revolving around web development. HTML, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, CSS, jQuery,
Sass, Node.js and a lot of other subjects that I find interesting.

You can also find projects I've put online for you to use for free. I created a lot of jQuery plugins in the past which
are free to use.
