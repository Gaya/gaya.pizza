The current design has been around for almost five months now. When I made that design, I didn't really aim for it to be a weblog and didn't pay much attention to its functionallity. I must say that in that time the design was kind of growing out of me and thought I needed a new one.

After a few days of thinking and many drafts I created a version suited better for my blogging needs. Read the post to see a large preview.

Tell me what you think about this concept. It's not fully done yet, but it gives an idea of what the looks will be.  
 Thanks for watching!
