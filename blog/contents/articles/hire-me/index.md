After a long time of hard consideration I decided to leave my current job. It's an awesome place to work at and the
management couldn't be better, but I feel like I am moving in a different direction.

That said: I am looking for a new job.

[As I mentioned before](/articles/stuck-at-your-web-development-job-break-your-routine/), being stuck at my job is not
something I want. Being unhappy is something I want to avoid and looking for something else seems like the best solution.

##What I am looking for
Currently I am largely interested in working on JavaScript applications, from in-browser web applications to server-side
Node.js applications. I also love automating all the things and streamlining the development process, the less coders
need to do, the better.

As much as I love working in offices, I am also open to working remote.

##Let me know if you know something
If you might know a company that is looking for a JavaScript developer and wants to talk to me, please let me know by
sending an [email to hi@gaya.ninja](mailto:hi@gaya.ninja). You can also [reach me through my contact page](/contact) or
[my Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/GayaNinja).
