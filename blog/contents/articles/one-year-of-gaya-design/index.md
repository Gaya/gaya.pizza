On this day, but about 365 days ago, I published [my first article](http://www.gayadesign.com/diy/garagedoor-effect-using-javascript/). From that day I devoted quite a lot of my free time to this weblog, and still doing it with a smile! It's great to know where my little blog is after a year and I am very thankful for the people who made this possible.

The start
---------

 In the beginning I didn't know anything about blogging, but I've always had the urge to go and spread the stuff that I made and share my knowledge with other people. And as we know, the Internet is a great medium to do that, so I started this blog. The idea to start a blog came from Marco of [Marcofolio.net](http://www.marcofolio.net) (at the time a classmate). He kind of made me want to do a blog myself. Seeing that his blog was a success, I wanted to start something myself. Thanks Marco for inspiring me! After a few months of running my blog on a self made system (which was enough at the time), it was time to boost the action and convert the whole blog into a [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) blog, and then it started. Such a great platform to run a blog on, if you're not yet running Wordpress: do it now! Traffic boom
------------

 A few months in I saw that a lot of new comments appeared on my blog. I must have had a mention somewhere nice. And it was, not just somewhere! In [an article on Nettuts](http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/best-of-the-web-january/)! I want to once again thank [Drew Douglass](http://dev-tips.com/) for this. I believe he gave me a big boost into the developers community on the Internet, even though I wrote script.aculo.us scripts back then. He's an awesome dude who like me just has a passion for web development and wants to share it with the world. Few other thank yous
--------------------

 I want to thank everyone at [Cybox](http://www.cybox.nl/) (the place I work) for their support for what I do and giving me the opportunity to host this weblog on their servers. We've experienced some crazy stuff thanks to this blog, but the servers will always survive! Check out the websites of my co-workers: [Sieb](http://siebdesign.com/), [Pim](http://hypekid.com), [Bas](http://www.bashendriks.nl/), [Nando](http://www.nando.nl/), [Rutger](http://www.rutgerdragstra.com/). **You guys ROCK!** Also a HUGE thank you to YOU, my readers, you make this all happen! If it weren't for you, I'd be eating some crisps and play Nintendo games in all the time I've spend in the social networks of this wonderful community. I really love how a lot of people from all around the world are contacting me and talk about stuff I've written on my website. A lot of this conversing goes on [on Twitter](http://twitter.com/gayadesign). Really love how fast stuff goes over there and the ease of just starting a conversation. Thank you all readers, followers and subscribers! I'd also like to thank the people at FUEL for giving me the opportunity to write for one of their blogs. As some of you may know, I was an editor at [FUEL Your Coding](http://fuelyourcoding.com/) for a while and let them use my articles to give the website a kick start. Since it started to take up way too much of my time I had to stop, which was a bummer. But as you can see, mister [Douglass Neiner](http://dougneiner.com/) is doing a great job keeping that site alive! Thank you [Adelle](http://adellecharles.com/), [Doug](http://dougneiner.com/), [Josh](http://joshuasmibert.com/), [Michelle](http://michellekrasniak.com/) and all the other FUEL people for the great time at FUEL. You enlighten the community. A look at 2010

 In 2010 I want to bring you a lot of jQuery madness and I am planning on doing another blog along with some friends, but that's just another surprise waiting for you in 2010. Thank you all for reading my blog and I hope to make next year a great one!
