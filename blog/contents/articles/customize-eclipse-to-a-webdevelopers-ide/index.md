There are a lot of ways to become a better, or at least faster, webdeveloper. For instance the use of a framework like [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/) to make the developing process rapid. One of the main things I found boosting my productivity is using a nice [IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). This article will describe how to create a PHP developer's IDE using Eclipse, Aptana and PDT. [![Customize Eclipse to a webdeveloper's IDE](/articles/idepost.jpg "Customize Eclipse to a webdeveloper's IDE")](http://www.gayadesign.com/articles/customize-eclipse-to-a-webdevelopers-ide/)<span id="more-132"></span> What should we do? Download the Aptana standalone or Eclipse? I my case, Eclipse was already installed. So I already  know how to work with it now. I prefer having Aptana plugged into Eclipse because I also use Eclipse for other purposes than webdevelopment. This article will use the Aptana Eclipse plugin. Follow the step by step guide to get a nice IDE for PHP developers. **1. Download Eclipse** An obvious step would be to download Eclipse. So get it at: [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) Pick Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers and choose your OS to the right.

<div class="border">![1](/articles/1.png "1")</div>**2. Extract Eclipse somewhere** Eclipse will be downloaded as an archive. Pick a location you want to unzip the folder *eclipse*. Startup *eclipse*. <div class="border">![2](/articles/2.png "2")</div>**3. Get Aptana Eclipse Plugin** Go to [http://www.aptana.com/studio/download](http://www.aptana.com/studio/download) and choose *Eclipse Plugin* as the installation type. Click *download*, this will lead to an instructions page. <div class="border">![3](/articles/3.png "3")</div>**4. Follow instructions** Follow the instruction on the page. Or read the quick plugin install guide I wrote. 1. In Eclipse go to: *help* > *software updates*
2. Click on the tab *available software*
3. Click on the *+ add site* button to the right.
4. Enter the url from step 3 of the main guide *(http://update.aptana.com/update/studio/3.2/)*
5. Check the newly appeared box
6. Click *install*
7. *next* > *I accept* > *next*
8. wait... a while
9. restart eclipse

**5. Aptana will ask you to install SVN** You'd probably want this! I tell you. SVN can save your projects. **6. Time to install PHP functionality** Go to: *help* > *software updates***7. Add DLTK site** In the tab *available software* click on *add site*. Enter the following url: *http://download.eclipse.org/technology/dltk/updates-dev/1.0/***8. Add PDT site** Again, *add site* but now with this url: *http://download.eclipse.org/tools/pdt/updates/2.0/***9. Select Dynamic Languages Toolkit checkbox** In the list to the left, two new sites should have appeared. Expand the Dynamic Languages site and check Dynamic Languages Tooltik (not the uncategorized). <div class="border">![10](/articles/10.png "10")</div>**10. Select PDT update checkbox **Seach for *PDT* in the site list. Again do not check uncategorized. <div class="border">![11](/articles/11.png "11")</div>**11. Install the plugins **Click *install*. Follow the instructions. Wait a while and restart Eclipse. **12. Open the Aptana perspective** Go to: *window *> *open perspective *> *other *> *aptana ***13. Add an FTP site** In the *file browser* (bottom left of the IDE) right click on *FTP *> *Add New FTP Site*. <div class="border">![14](/articles/14.png "14")</div>**14. Fill in information** Fill in your FTP account information. Preferably a test server for now, so you can mess around with the IDE a bit. **15. Start browsing your FTP folders **You can now use the *file browser* to browse your PHP projects online. When you *open *a file it will be downloaded and when you *save* one it will be uploaded to your server. This is simple and quick if you have to adjust something in a PHP project. Now you can start experiencing a rich IDE customized to your webdeveloping needs.
